<h1>Anne Frank's Diary</h1>

<div>
    Anne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. Initially, she wrote it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast from London that after the war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people under the German occupation,
    which could be made available to the public. As an example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries.
