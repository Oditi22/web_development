    <h2>SEPTEMBER 28, 1942</h2>
    <p>So far you truly have been a great source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty, 
       whom I now write to regularly. This way of keeping a diary is much nicer, 
       and now I can hardly wait for those moments when I’m able to write in you.
       Oh, I’m so glad I brought you along!

    <h2>SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942</h2>
    <p>Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me.
       Not only because I’ve never written anything before, but also because it 
       seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in 
       the musings of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. 
       I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.
     <span  style="color:palevioletred">“Paper has more patience than people.”</span>
     I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and 
     was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to 
     stay in or go out.</p>
