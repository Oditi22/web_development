    <p>I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, 
       as I have never been able to confide in anyone, 
       and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.</p>

    <h2>SEPTEMBER 28, 1942</h2>
    <p>So far you truly have been a great source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty, 
       whom I now write to regularly. This way of keeping a diary is much nicer, 
       and now I can hardly wait for those moments when I’m able to write in you.
       Oh, I’m so glad I brought you along!
