<p>Sonargaon is one of the old capitals of the historic region of Bengal and was an administrative center of
   eastern Bengal. It was also a river port. Its hinterland was the center of the muslin trade in Bengal, 
   with a large population of weavers and artisans. According to ancient Greek and Roman accounts, 
   an emporium was located in this hinterland, which archaeologists have identified with the Wari-Bateshwar 
   ruins of the Gangaridai Empire. The area was a base for the Vanga, Gangaridai, Samatata, Sena, and Deva 
   dynasties. Sonargaon gained importance during the Delhi Sultanate. It was the capital of the sultanate 
   ruled by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah and his son Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah. It hosted a royal court and mint 
   of the Bengal Sultanate and also the capital of the Bengal Sultanate under the reign of Ghiyasuddin Azam 
   Shah.</p>

<p> Sonargaon became one of the most important townships in Bengal. Many immigrants settled in the area. 
    The Sultans built mosques and tombs. It was later the seat of the Baro-Bhuyan confederacy that resisted 
    Mughal expansion under the leadership of Isa Khan and his son Musa Khan. Sonargaon then became a district 
    of Mughal Bengal. During British colonial rule, merchants built many Indo-Saracenic townhouses in the Panam 
    neighborhood. Its importance was eventually eclipsed by the nearby Port of Narayanganj which was set up in 
    1862. Sonargaon draws many tourists each year in Bangladesh. It hosts the Bangladesh Folk Arts and Crafts 
    Foundation, as well as various archaeological sites, Sufi shrines, Hindu temples, and historic mosques and 
    tombs.</p>

<p>Sonargaon was an ancient center of muslin production and textile manufacturing. 
   Sonargaon was famous for a cotton based cloth called Khasa for its finest quality.
   The fertile farmland around the town also generated rice exports. 
   The English traveler Ralph Fitch described the cotton textile weaving culture of the area in 
   the 16th-century. Weavers formed a large part of the population. In 1580, he states "The houses here, 
   as they be in the most part of India, are very little, and covered with straw, hay and a few mats round 
   about the walls, and the door to keep out the Tygers and the Foxes. Many of the people are very rich. 
   Here they will eat no flesh, nor kill no beast; They Hue of Rice, milke, and fruits, they go with a 
   little cloth before them, and all the rest of their bodies is naked. Great store of cotton cloth goeth 
   from hence, and much rice, wherewith they serue all India, Ceylon, Pegu, Malacca".[27] Sonargaon was a 
   river port with access to the Bay of Bengal through the mouth of the Bengali delta.
   Maritime ships travelled between Sonargaon and southeast/west Asian countries.</p>
